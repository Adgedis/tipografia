		<div class="body">A. I AM tired, and now I'm aware that I look like shit. <br><br>

Or.... <br><br>

B. I'm NOT tired, and now I'm aware that I look like shit. <br> <br>	

The only way your query would be useful is if it were <br> the preface to a longer, more solution-oriented <br> statement like..."Hey! Are you tired? Because I just set <br> up a hammock in your office." Or..."Hey! Are you tired of <br> homophobia? Me, too. Let's start a rally." <br><br>

But, NO! You never want to start a rally. You just want to <br> talk about the bags under my eyes. How I look like <br> Meeko, the Raccoon from 'Pocohantas,'and he's not <br> even a recognizable Disney character. Asshole!</div>
